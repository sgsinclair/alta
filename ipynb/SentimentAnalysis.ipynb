    "[Sentiment analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) is a general term used in text mining to refer to the process of trying to automatically determine the mood or opinion of texts. For example, we might be interested in reading through a large quantity of tweets on a particular topic (issue, product, person, event, etc.) to determine if they are generally positive or negative. This is a typical task in determining polarity, or the general orientation of each text toward to poles. The poles can be positive or negative or any other binary pair (happy/sad, calm/excited, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways of doing sentiment analysis and one of the most common ways is to use training sets to develop models of texts that can then be used to read and classify new texts that aren't part of the training set. For instance, NLTK has a corpus of movie reviews that have been classified by hand as either positive or negative, these could be used to classify new movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a high-level Python module called [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) that makes use of the movie reviews corpus and that is very easy to use. Once [installed](https://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html), you can do something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from textblob import TextBlob\n",
    "text = \"Textblob is amazingly simple to use. What great fun!\"\n",
    "testimonial = TextBlob(text) # any string (such as our sonnets)\n",
    "testimonial.sentiment.polarity # this produces a positive value of 0.39166666666666666```\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of this approach depends in large part on the training set and its relevance to the corpus you want to analyze. Analyzing Shakespeare's sonnets based on movie reviews may not be quite ideal. As importantly, it can be tricky to understand and tweak a model once it's been loaded into a classifier (such as [a Naive Bayes Classifier](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.classify.html#nltk.classify.naivebayes.NaiveBayesClassifier)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, classifiers depend on relevant training sets, and we don't always have those. We can take a simpler approach and perform sentiment analysis based on word lists."
