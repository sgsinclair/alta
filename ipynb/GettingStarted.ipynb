Your results may vary, but chances are that somewhere near the top will appear a Python 3 Documentation Tutorial on [Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) which refers to the built-in [print()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) function.

However, an even more accessible page is another of the top results at [Python: Get Today’s Current Date and Time](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-get-current-date-time-in-python/). Part way down the page is an example that looks helpful:\n",

    "#!/usr/bin/python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, this assumes that we're running a Python file from the command line – the first line indicates the location of the python interpreter ```#!/usr/bin/python``` (this is called a [shebang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix%29) line). We don't need this line at all since we're using Jupyter.\n",

Python actually has a relatively small set of built-in functions that don't require importing, especially compared to some other programming languages (like PHP). The ```print()``` function we've already seen is an example of a built-in function. The challenge can be finding the names of the modules and then finding the functions that we want to use.\n",

    "This is the heart of what we want and demonstrates the use of <a href=\"Glossary.ipynb#Function\" >calling a function </a> that belongs to the ```time``` module that we imported. The ```time``` module has a ```strftime``` function and takes an <a href=\"Glossary.ipynb#argument\" title=\"A value which is passed to a function when called\" >argument</a>  that indicates the format to use (in this case ```%c``` is a format for a simple date and time representation). More formats are listed and explained in the [time.strftime()](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/time.html?highlight=strftime#time.strftime) reference page.\n",

The ```now``` on the left side of this statement isn't a built-in keyword in Python, it's a variable name that the programmer has chosen (a place-holder for a value that can change). Whatever the value of ```time.strftime(\"%c\")``` gets assigned to the variable named ```now```. Note that just assigning a value doesn't mean that it will be displayed (printed), so we'd need to do that explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, we don't even need to assign a value to a <a href=\"Glossary.ipynb#Variable\" title=\"A variable stores a piece of data and gives it a specific name\" >variable, </a> we can just print the value directly by adapting the example we found."
