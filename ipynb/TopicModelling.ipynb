    "Topic modelling is a text mining technique that attempts to automatically identify groups of terms that are more likely to occur together in individual documents (or other text units, such as document segments). Topic modelling tends to be less interested in terms that occur uniformly throughout a text (like function words) and less interested in terms that occur rarely, and sometimes we're left with clusters of words – called topics – that are suggestive of a coherent group.\n",

    "Topic modelling is a good example of a text mining technique that can be challenging to understand (without considerable mathematical and computer training). The fact that we don't fully understand how it works shouldn't necessarily stop us from using it, but it does mean we should approach any results with additional circumspection, since we may be tempted to make interpretations that aren't necessarily justified. Even throwing a bag of words in the air and seeing how they land might also produce some intriguing and even useful results. Topic modelling can suggest some compelling associations between terms that we may not have considered otherwise, but it's probably best to go back to the texts to investigate further.\n",
    "\n",
    "One strength of topic modelling (in some circumstances) is that it's a form of unsupervised text mining, which means that it doesn't require any prior training sets in order to start working. Like frequency counts of strings, it doesn't care which language it's working with (and it can even be used for analyzing non-linguistic sequences).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the Python library [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) for our topic modelling. This library has the benefit of being relatively easy to use, though alternatives like [Mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu) (in the programming language Java) are also widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gensim offers a way to compute topics using a technique called [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation). As can be seen from the Gensim [LdaModel()](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html#gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel) documentation, there's a number of parameters that can be set and tweaked that affect the modelling work. Again, these parameters (alpha, decay, etc.) can be rather opaque to understand, but they should also be seen as an invitation to experiment – to try different settings with one's particular corpus to see which ones produce the most promising results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't go into much detail for transforming our bags of words (list of terms for our list of documents) into a topic model, but the process is actually fairly short. We just need to interact with the high-level gensim library."
