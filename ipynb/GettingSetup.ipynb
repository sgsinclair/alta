    "[<img src=\"images/logo_anaconda.png\" alt=\"Anaconda logo\" style=\"float: right; width: 100px; margin-left: 1em;\" />](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)  Setting up Jupyter is (usually) a smooth and painless process. The easiest and recommended option is to [download and install Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which is a freely available bundle that includes Python, Jupyter, and several very other things that will be useful to us. It's *very important* for the purposes of our notebooks to select a version for [Mac OS X](https://www.continuum.io/downloads#_macosx), [Windows](https://www.continuum.io/downloads#_windows) or [Linux](https://www.continuum.io/downloads#_unix) of **Anaconda with Python 3.x** (not Python 2.x).\n",

If you encounter difficulties, you may want to consult the [Jupyter installation documentation](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html)."

During a normal setup on Mac, there should be a Launcher icon created on your desktop – you can click on that. On Windows, you should find Anaconda in your Programs hierarchy.\n",

    "1. A web browser window that shows a directory tree for the default path of Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default path on a Mac is the user's \"Home\" directory. We probably don't want to create Jupyter notebooks there, so we'll navigate to another directory (like \"Documents\") and create a new folder (like \"Notebooks\"). The location and names aren't important but we'll need to remember where our notebooks are for future use."

To do that we do the following:\n",
